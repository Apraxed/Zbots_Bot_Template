# Info about the commands in this:
Discord TOS Concerns
-
- in [owner_only_commands](https://github.com/ZbotDyn0/zbotspybottemplate/blob/master/zlib/cogs/owner_only_commands.py) if the commands in there are used without the owner of the servers permission you are voilating discords TOS, the owner of the server will have all rights to go and get your discord account DELETED!
- If you are doing the command on your own server, that's fine
- If you get permission from the server owner then you need photo or video proof

Stuff I'm doing to protect myself
-
- MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON YOU ARE TALKING TO FOR PERMISSION TO USE EITHER OF THE COMMANDS IN [owner_only_commands](https://github.com/ZbotDyn0/zbotspybottemplate/blob/master/zlib/cogs/owner_only_commands.py), if I get blamed because "Zbot made the command" I will fight it, I have tons of proof that I warned you
- If you go after me and try getting me deleted I will fight back
- I am not responsible for you loosing your account for this, if you modify this file in any way, shape, or from
- Yes it is my code, it isn't my responsibility for your mistakes you make with my code
- As soon as you take my code to use for your reasons,  **I am not responsibe for your action**
- I've never been deleted off of discord, even if you just put the token in the bot (needed!) I am not taking responsibility as it is now my code that you modified
- Yes i know this section has been longer then the other but I need to protect myself

Why did i add it?
-
I added this code as I have a friend whos server got raided and they needed one of the commands, the delete all channels command as there server was TOTALLED

I don't want anyone to have there discord server hacked and they aren't able to stop it, it sucks like actually

I do not want anyone else going through the pain and stress he went through deleting all the channels as they flooded each one

The delete all channels command is ment to be a fail safe just so that if you do get raided you can delete all the channels without doing one by one and it is quicker to end the raid

The delete all emojis one is in case someone creates innapropriate emojis, you can delete them all at once

The other commands
-
The meme command is completely configurable,
it has a Random Number Generator and it chooses one of two subreddits to post a random image from one of those subreddits

if you go into [config.py](https://github.com/ZbotDyn0/zbotspybottemplate/blob/master/config/config.py), you can configure the passwords for the password protected commands, the token, the prefix, the subreddits for the meme command, the user reports channel for the modmail, and as I add more commands that can be configured,
I will be adding more configs in [config.py](https://github.com/ZbotDyn0/zbotspybottemplate/blob/master/config/config.py)
