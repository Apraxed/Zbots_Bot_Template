# Zbot's discord bot library
Python library for all of Zbots bot's that he is currently working on and future ones!
addon for discord.py made by yours truely, @ZbotDyn0

# Use
if you want to use this library, go ahead but just know, all of the commands use `client` rather then `bot` so you are going to need to do `client.run` and `client = commands.Bot(command_prefix='prefix')` rather then the more widely used `bot` varients of the commands

# Plans
I plan on updating this library as I make more bots and commands, I also plan on making a `bot` version of the library
